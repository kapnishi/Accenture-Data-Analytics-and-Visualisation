# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualisation

## Project overview
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers in 2008 from a large social media conglomerate, which has rapidly grown to over 500 million monthly active users. Focused on prioritizing content over individual users, the platform emphasizes anonymity and diverse user reactions to content. Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge with over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs posted daily. As the company plans to go public by the end of the next year, Social Buzz recognizes the need for external expertise to navigate their scaling challenges.
